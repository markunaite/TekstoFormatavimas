        <h2>What is branding?</h2>
        <div>
            <p class="first">
                Branding is certainly not a light topic – whole publications & hundreds of books have been written on
                the topic,
                however to put it in a nutshell you could describe a ‘brand’ as an organisation, service or product with
                a
                ‘personality’ that is shaped by the perceptions of the audience. On that note, it should also be stated
                that
                a
                designer cannot “make” a brand – only the audience can do this. A designer forms the foundation of the
                brand.

                Many people believe a brand only consists of a few elements – some colours, some fonts, a logo, a slogan
                and
                maybe some music added in too. In reality, it is much more complicated than that. You might say that a
                brand
                is
                a ‘corporate image’.

                The fundamental idea and core concept behind having a ‘corporate image’ is that everything a company
                does,
                everything it owns and everything it produces should reflect the values and aims of the business as a
                whole.

                It is the consistency of this core idea that makes up the company, driving it, showing what it stands
                for,
                what
                it believes in and why they exist. It is not purely some colours, some typefaces, a logo and a slogan.

                As an example, let’s look at the well known IT company, Apple. Apple as a company, projects a humanistic
                corporate culture and a strong corporate ethic, one which is characterised by volunteerism, support of
                good
                causes & involvement in the community. These values of the business are evident throughout everything
                they
                do,
                from their innovative products and advertising, right through to their customer service. Apple is an
                emotionally
                humanist brand that really connects with people – when people buy or use their products or services;
                they
                feel
                part of the brand, like a tribe even. It is this emotional connection that creates their brand – not
                purely
                their products and a bite sized logo.

                For a more thorough understanding of branding, in simple terms, I recommend Wally Olin’s: The Brand
                Handbook
                which I quote is “an essential, easy-reference guide to brilliant branding”.

        <h2>What is identity design?</h2>

        <div>
            <p class="second">
                One major role in the ‘brand’ or ‘corporate image’ of a company is its identity.

                In most cases, identity design is based around the visual devices used within a company, usually
                assembled
                within a set of guidelines. These guidelines that make up an identity usually administer how the
                identity is
                applied throughout a variety of mediums, using approved colour palettes, fonts, layouts, measurements
                and so
                forth. These guidelines ensure that the identity of the company is kept coherent, which in turn, allows
                the
                brand as a whole, to be recognisable.
            </p>

        </div>

        <h3>The identity or ‘image’ of a company is made up of many visual devices:</h3>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>A Logo (The symbol of the entire identity & brand)</li>
            <li>Stationery (Letterhead + business card + envelopes, etc.)</li>
            <li>Marketing Collateral (Flyers, brochures, books, websites, etc.)</li>
            <li>Products & Packaging (Products sold and the packaging in which they come in)</li>
            <li>Apparel Design (Tangible clothing items that are worn by employees)</li>
            <li>Signage (Interior & exterior design)</li>
            <li>Messages & Actions (Messages conveyed via indirect or direct modes of communication)</li>
            <li>Other Communication (Audio, smell, touch, etc.)</li>
            <li>Anything visual that represents the business.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="third">All of these things make up an identity and should support the brand as a whole. The logo
            however, is the corporate identity and brand all wrapped up into one identifiable mark. This mark is the
            avatar and symbol of the business as a whole.</p>
